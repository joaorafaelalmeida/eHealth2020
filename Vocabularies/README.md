#### Introduction
This compressed folder contains two files:

 + codiesp-D_codes.tsv: list of CIE10-Diagn√≥sticos terms (2018 version) with their description in Spanish and in English.
 + codiesp-P_codes.tsv: list of CIE10-Procedimiento terms (2018 version) with their description in Spanish and in English. In addition, the list also contains the codes until the 4th axis, which are also used in the CodiEsp-P track due to annotation reasons.

A limited number of codes do not have English description because they were removed from the English version but maintained in the Spanish version of the terminology.

#### Format: 
Tab-separated file with 3 columns
code	es-description	en-description
